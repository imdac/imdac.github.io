A role in accessibility terms amounts to a shorthand indicator for a particular UI pattern. ARIA provides a vocabulary of patterns we can use via the role attribute on any HTML element.</p><p>When we applied <code>role=&quot;checkbox&quot;</code> in the previous example, we were telling assistive technology that the element should follow the &quot;checkbox&quot; pattern.

In fact, ARIA is the only way to add accessible help or description text. Let&#39;s look at the properties ARIA uses to create accessible labels.</p><h4 id="aria-label" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aria-label" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <code>aria-label</code></h4><p>The <code>aria-label</code> allows us to specify a string to be used as the accessible label. This overrides any other native labeling mechanism, such as a label element â€” for example, if a button has both text content and an <code>aria-label</code>, only the <code>aria-label</code> value will be used.</p><p>You might use an <code>aria-label</code> attribute when you have some kind of visual indication of an element&#39;s purpose, such as a button that uses a graphic instead of text, but still need to clarify that purpose for anyone who cannot access the visual indication, such as a button that uses only an image to indicate its purpose.</p><h4 id="aria-labelledby" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aria-labelledby" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <code>aria-labelledby</code></h4><p>The <code>aria-labelledby</code> allows us to specify the ID of another element in the DOM as an element&#39;s label.</p><p>This is much like using a label element, with some key differences.</p><ol><li>The <code>aria-labelledby</code> may be used on any element, not just labelable elements.</li><li>While a <code>label</code> element refers to the thing it labels, the relationship is reversed in the the case of <code>aria-labelledby</code> â€” the thing being labeled refers to the thing that labels it.</li><li>Only one <code>label</code> element may be associated with a labelable element, but <code>aria-labelledby</code> can take a list of IDREFs to compose a label from multiple elements. The label will be concatenated in the order that the IDREFs are given.</li><li>You can use <code>aria-labelledby</code> to refer to elements that are hidden and would otherwise not be in the accessibility tree. For example, you could add a hidden <code>span</code> next to an element you want to label, and refer to that with <code>aria-labelledby</code>.</li><li>However, since ARIA only affects the accessibility tree, <code>aria-labelledby</code> does not give you the familiar label-clicking behavior you get from using a <code>label</code> element.</li></ol><p>Importantly, <code>aria-labelledby</code> overrides all other name sources for an element. So, for example, if an element has both an <code>aria-labelledby</code> and an <code>aria-label</code>, or an <code>aria-labelledby</code> and a native HTML label, the <code>aria-labelledby</code> label always takes precedence.</p><h3 id="aria-relationships" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aria-relationships" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ARIA Relationships</h3>',10),Q=n('<p>The <code>aria-labelledby</code> is an example of a relationship attribute. A relationship attribute creates a semantic relationship between elements on the page regardless of their DOM relationship. In the case of <code>aria-labelledby</code>, that relationship is &quot;this element is labelled by that element&quot;.</p><p>The ARIA specification lists eight relationship attributes. Six of these, <code>aria-activedescendant</code>, <code>aria-controls</code>, <code>aria-describedby</code>, <code>aria-labelledby</code>, and <code>aria-owns</code>, take a reference to one or more elements to create a new link between elements on the page. The difference in each case is what that link means and how it is presented to users.</p><h4 id="aria-owns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aria-owns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <code>aria-owns</code></h4><p>The <code>aria-owns</code> is one of the most widely used ARIA relationships. This attribute allows us to tell assistive technology that an element that is separate in the DOM should be treated as a child of the current element, or to rearrange existing child elements into a different order. For example, if a pop-up sub-menu is visually positioned near its parent menu, but cannot be a DOM child of its parent because it would affect the visual presentation, you can use <code>aria-owns</code> to present the sub-menu as a child of the parent menu to a screen reader.</p><h4 id="aria-activedescendant" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aria-activedescendant" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <code>aria-activedescendant</code></h4><p>The <code>aria-activedescendant</code> plays a related role. Just as the active element of a page is the one that has focus, setting the active descendant of an element allows us to tell assistive technology that an element should be presented to the user as the focused element when its parent actually has the focus. For example, in a listbox, you might want to leave page focus on the listbox container, but keep its <code>aria-activedescendant</code> attribute updated to the currently selected list item. This makes the currently selected item appear to assistive technology as if it is the focused item.</p><h4 id="aria-describedby" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aria-describedby" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <code>aria-describedby</code></h4><p>The <code>aria-describedby</code> provides an accessible description in the same way that aria-labelledby provides a label. Like aria-labelledby, <code>aria-describedby</code> may reference elements that are otherwise not visible, whether hidden from the DOM, or hidden from assistive technology users. This is a useful technique when there is some extra explanatory text that a user might need, whether it applies only to users of assistive technology or all users.</p><p>A common example is a password input field that is accompanied by some descriptive text explaining the minimum password requirements. Unlike a label, this description may or may not ever be presented to the user; they may have a choice of whether to access it, or it may come after all the other information, or it may be pre-empted by something else. For example, if the user is entering information, their input will be echoed back and may interrupt the element&#39;s description. Thus, a description is a great way to communicate supplementary, but not essential, information; it won&#39;t get in the way of more critical information such as the element&#39;s role.</p><h4 id="aria-posinset-aria-setsize" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aria-posinset-aria-setsize" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <code>aria-posinset</code> &amp; <code>aria-setsize</code></h4><p>The remaining relationship attributes are a little different, and work together. The <code>aria-posinset</code> (&quot;position in set&quot;) and the <code>aria-setsize</code> (&quot;size of set&quot;) are about defining a relationship between sibling elements in a set, such as a list.</p><p>When the size of a set cannot be determined by the elements present in the DOM â€” such as when lazy rendering is used to avoid having all of a large list in the DOM at once â€” <code>aria-setsize</code> can specify the actual set size, and <code>aria-posinset</code> can specify the element&#39;s position in the set. For example, in a set that might contain 1000 elements, you could say that a particular element has an <code>aria-posinset</code> of 857 even though it appears first in the DOM, and then use dynamic HTML techniques to ensure that the user can explore the full list on demand.</p><h3 id="hidden-content" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hidden-content" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Hidden Content</h3>',13),Z=n(`<h4 id="aria-hidden" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aria-hidden" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <code>aria-hidden</code></h4><p>Another important technique in fine-tuning the experience for assistive technology users involves ensuring that only relevant parts of the page are exposed to assistive technology. There are several ways to ensure that a section of the DOM does not get exposed to accessibility APIs.</p><p>First, anything that is explicitly hidden from the DOM will also not be included in the accessibility tree. So anything that has a CSS style of visibility: hidden or display: none or uses the HTML5 hidden attribute will also be hidden from assistive technology users.</p><p>However, an element that is not visually rendered but not explicitly hidden is still included in the accessibility tree. One common technique is to include &quot;screen reader only text&quot; in an element that is absolute positioned offscreen.</p><div class="language-css line-numbers-mode" data-ext="css"><pre class="language-css"><code><span class="token selector">.sr-only</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

Doing this instructs the browser to fit your content to the screen size, so users don&#39;t just see a bunch of scrunched-up text.</li></ul><div class="custom-container danger"><p class="custom-container-title">Warning</p><p>When using the viewport meta tag, make sure you don&#39;t set <code>maximum-scale=1</code> or set <code>user-scaleable=no</code>. Let users zoom if they need to!</p></div><ul><li>Another technique to keep in mind is designing with a responsive grid. As you saw with the Udacity site, designing with a grid means your content will reflow when the page changes size. Often these layouts are produced using relative units like percents, ems, or rems instead of hard-coded pixel values. The advantage of doing it this way is that text and content can enlarge and force other items down the page. So the DOM order and the reading order remain the same, even if the layout changes because of magnification.</li><li>Also, consider using relative units like em or rem for things like text size, instead of pixel values. Some browsers support resizing text only in user preferences, and if you&#39;re using a pixel value for text, this setting will not affect your copy. If, however, you&#39;ve used relative units throughout, then the site copy will update to reflect the user&#39;s preference.</li><li>Finally, when your design is displayed on a mobile device, you should ensure that interactive elements like buttons or links are large enough, and have enough space around them, to make them easy to press without accidentally overlapping onto other elements. This benefits all users, but is especially helpful for anyone with a motor impairment.</li></ul>',4);function se(ne,ie){const i=o("ExternalLinkIcon"),s=o("Youtube");return c(),l("div",null,[h,e("p",null,[e("em",null,[a("This page contains excerpts from the "),e("a",p,[a("Web Accessibility"),t(i)]),a(" course from Udacity and "),e("a",u,[a("Accessibility Web Fundamentals"),t(i)]),a(" page from Google.")])]),t(s,{id:"3w7imFuXD8k",citation:"This video was created by Udacity as part of the <a href='https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud891' target='_blank'>Web Accessibility</a> course"}),e("p",null,[e("a",m,[a("Accessibility"),t(i)]),a(' is the experience of users who might be outside the narrow range of the "typical" user, who might access or interact with things differently than you expect.
