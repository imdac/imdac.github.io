For starters, as projects grow, the amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript grows. Before long, the size of the project will slow development and production performance. But by embracing build tools, a project can be structured to keep it manageable for developers while providing a superior experience for the end-user.</p><p>But build tools are not without their problems. They can have a large learning curve, poor documentation, and significant upfront time cost to get a project running. An alternative is to use frontend tooling. These small applications handle all the configuration and setup to get developers up and running as soon as possible. And Vite is no exception.</p><p>What separates Vite from other similar tools is its speed. Vite uses esbuild as its bundler instead of the more popular webpack, which can result in a 100x faster bundling. Vite also leverages new advancements, including browser support of ES modules and the rise of JavaScript tools written in compile-to-native languages. Vite is also framework agonistic, so learning Vite doesn&#39;t limit you to a single framework.</p><h2 id="creating-a-project" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-a-project" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Creating a project</h2><p>Vite can scaffold a new Vue project by using the following command:</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-ext="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code><span class="token function">npm</span> create vite@latest
