The DSN tells PDO which database to connect to.</p><p>The first part of the DSN is identifies the PDO driver to use. Remember that PDO is a database independent and can be used by a number of different database management systems, so it is important inform PDO which one will be used.</p><p>The PDO driver is followed by a series of key/value paris each separated by a semicolon. Each PDO driver will use slightly different key/value pairs. For this class, we will be focusing on the MySQL database, so the DSN will look something like this:</p><div class="language-php line-numbers-mode" data-ext="php"><pre class="language-php"><code><span class="token variable">$dsn</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string single-quoted-string">&#39;mysql:host=localhost;dbname=movies&#39;</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
