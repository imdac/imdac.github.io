The Model is the data of the application usually represented by a database. The View is the user interface and displays data from the model and received input from the user. Lastly, the Controller is the bridge between the Model and View. The Controller will request the data from the Model, process the data and then send it off to the View. The Model and View will never communicate directly as all communication will happen through the Controller. Now, some frameworks, like Laravel, will also include a Router. A router will receive a request from a user and determine which controller should handle that request. The main advantage of using MVC is that each part is not directly tied to any other. This loose coupling allows for any part of the web application to be replaced quickly and easily.",-1),_=r('<h2 id="what-are-the-laravel-requirements" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-the-laravel-requirements" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What are the Laravel Requirements?</h2><p>Because Laravel is a back-end PHP framework, it does require a local development environment.
